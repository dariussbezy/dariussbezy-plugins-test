# Jump to Ping for Valenced

Find unread pings in one place and jump to their messages. Version: **1.1.0-beta**.

## Features

- **Profile bar button** beside the notifications bell, using a Discord icon button.
- **Unread ping list** for up to 50 chats, with channel/server or DM names, author, message preview, time and unread count.
- **Jump to a message** by tapping its row. Hold the profile bar button to jump directly to the newest listed chat's first unread ping.
- **Resolve uncached pings** from recent channel messages. If an exact match cannot be found, open the oldest unread message instead.
- **Count badge** with a `99+` cap, and an option to keep the button visible when there are no pings.
- **Optional DMs** alongside mentions and replies. The list follows Discord's unread counters.
- **Channel message picker** when a channel has multiple pings, with an initial height based on the number of messages. DMs open directly.
- **Keep unvisited pings**, disabled by default, retains channel pings for individual navigation. It does not apply to DMs or group DMs.
- **Light and dark themes**, with Discord settings rows and a quick guide.

## Installation

In Valenced, open **Plugins → Advanced → Repository URL** and add:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dariussbezy/dariussbezy-plugins-test/main/index.json
```

Select the **beta** channel, install **Jump to Ping**, enable it and restart Discord. Open the plugin settings to configure **Only show with pings**, **Show count badge** and **Include DMs**.

## Privacy

The plugin uses Discord's unread counters and message cache. When resolving an uncached ping, it requests recent messages through Discord's own API, using your existing session. Nothing is sent to an external service.

Preferences are saved locally. Message previews and any unvisited channel pings remain in memory and are cleared when the plugin stops. No token or API key needs to be entered.
