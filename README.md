# dariussbezy's Plugins (Test)

dariussbezy's Valenced plugins and themes.

## Install

Add this single URL in **Valenced Settings → Plugins → Advanced → Repository URL**:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dariussbezy/dariussbezy-plugins-test/main/index.json
```

Choose the plugins you want from the **beta** channel. Existing plugin IDs are preserved. Restart Discord after updates when requested.

For an existing installation, open the plugin's options, set **Repository** to **dariussbezy's Plugins**, select the **beta** channel and enable **Allow updates**. Adding this catalog alone does not switch the repository an installed plugin follows. Switch each plugin before removing its old individual repository entry.
